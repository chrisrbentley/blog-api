# Blog REST API

This is a simple REST API for a blog built with Node.JS, Express, and MongoDB. It allows for post creation, retrieval, deletion and updating. The API also allows for users to be able to add comments to blogs, which can be managed by the admin from the content management system. The API uses JWT for authentication/authorization.
